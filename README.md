## Karel-The-Robot👾🤖
Divide a given map into 4 equal chambers – Do all the analysis to handle the special cases.
i.e. maps that can&#39;t be divided into 4 equal chambers should be divided into the biggest
possible number of equal chambers (3, 2, or 1).
- You are allowed to use double lines of beepers if you need to, however, you need to
observe that beepers use should be optimized.

Notes:
- Assume having enough number of beepers (say 1000) in Karel’s bag. You can use the
API to setup an initial value of the beepers.
- You can’t use the classes API to solve the assignment, and you should be using only
the functions given in Karel reference card. Karel is a black box that came out of the
factory with certain capabilities according to it’s reference card. The only exception
to that is initializing Karel’s bag with beepers.
Optimize your solution as follows:
- Karel should achieve his task with the lowest number of moves. Add a moves
counter to your code and print it while Karel is moving.
- You should minimize the number of lines in your code to the lowest possible number
of lines by writing reusable functions.
- Use the lowest possible number of beepers to achieve your task
